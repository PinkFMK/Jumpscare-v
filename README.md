# Heartstopper

This is a gimmick webpage that features a jumpscare effect triggered by a button click. The project is a refactored version of an [earlier project I made](https://github.com/ReemanS/simple-js) when I didn't have much experience in writing code, now implemented using React.

You can take a look and share the webpage with your friends through this link:

## Usage

The jumpscare effect is triggered by clicking the "Start the Experience" button. When clicked, a sound will play, and an image will appear instantly. The image and sound assets can be customized by replacing the respective files in the `assets` folder.
